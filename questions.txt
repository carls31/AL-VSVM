row 436 #P: we already did this at row 421-426
row 550 #P: check in 2Class Setting only first two records are used BY DEFAULT
row 637 #P: we can remove the redundancy then?
row 636 #P: yes but SOME of this data are used before for training/test/validate, right? 
row 738 #P: just for confirmation, the trainFeatVSVM is made only by VSVs?
roe 770 #P: we should keep the Random, but for the sake of balanced train set we use Balanced
row 36  trainControl -> how does actually work with the indexTrain
row 197  rbf_kernel -> that I added is required, right?
row 371 abs(pred) -> for the distance we need only positive values, right? (I added abs)
row 603 ref_added_or[1:250,]$distance = 1 -> which are the actual values for the distance? after norm, the max value 1
row 956 binaryClassProblem -> A LIST WITH THE CLASSES NAME ISN'T ENOUGH?
In svm what is the difference between probability class and distance class? see both related paper and script function

descriptive stats of the dataset/data visualization
check the values inside the computed vectors
check the accuracies

tune alter_label hyperparameter: how many label need to be relabeled?
overall hyperparameters optimization 

check why multiclass script is implemented differently from the binary ones

how to improve performance 
 - check how many CPU cores are present on the RSRG server and how to use them
 - vectorize: apply() {R function} + predict() {kernlab function}
